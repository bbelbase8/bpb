## Overview

I have extensive hands-on experience in the synthesis of high-quality single-crystal and polycrystalline samples of quantum magnetic and correlated electron materials. My work emphasizes reproducible crystal growth, careful control of stoichiometry, and preparation of samples suitable for low-temperature and high-field measurements.

## Single-Crystal Growth

I have grown single crystals using multiple techniques, depending on material chemistry and phase stability:

- **Flux growth** for layered and intermetallic compounds  
- **Chemical vapor transport (CVT)** for halides and chalcogenides  
- **Bridgman growth** for selected bulk crystals  

Representative materials synthesized include:
- TlYbSe₂ (single crystals)
- TlYbS₂ (single crystals)
- YbCr₆Ge₆
- Co-based trirutiles
- Related rare-earth chalcogenides and intermetallics

## Polycrystalline Sample Synthesis

For systematic studies and bulk measurements, I routinely prepare polycrystalline samples using:

- Solid-state reaction methods
- Multiple grinding and annealing cycles
- Controlled atmosphere synthesis for air-sensitive materials

Powder samples are optimized for phase purity and homogeneity prior to characterization.

## Sample Preparation and Laboratory Techniques

I am experienced in advanced sample preparation workflows, including:

- **Quartz tube sealing using a blowtorch** under vacuum or inert gas
- **High-temperature furnace operation** with precise thermal profiles
- **Glovebox handling** of air- and moisture-sensitive materials
- Safe handling and storage of reactive chemicals

## Outcome and Applications

The crystals and polycrystalline samples I have synthesized have been successfully used for:

- Low-temperature heat capacity, magnetization, and transport measurements
- Ultra-low-temperature AC susceptibility experiments
- Neutron scattering and high-field measurements at national laboratories

This synthesis work forms the foundation for detailed experimental investigations of magnetism, topology, and correlated electron behavior in quantum materials.
