## Overview

I have extensive hands-on experience in the synthesis of high-quality single-crystal and polycrystalline samples of quantum magnetic and correlated electron materials. My work emphasizes reproducible crystal growth, careful control of stoichiometry, and preparation of samples suitable for low-temperature and high-field measurements.

## Single-Crystal Growth

I have grown single crystals using multiple techniques, selected according to material chemistry, phase stability, and volatility:

- **Flux growth** for layered and intermetallic compounds  
- **Chemical vapor transport (CVT)** for halides and chalcogenides  
- **Bridgman growth** for selected bulk crystals  

Representative materials synthesized include:
- TlYbSe₂ (single crystals)
- TlYbS₂ (single crystals)
- YbCr₆Ge₆
- GdTe₃
- RI₃
- BaCo₂(AsO₄)₂
- Related rare-earth chalcogenides and intermetallic compounds

## Polycrystalline Sample Synthesis

For systematic studies and bulk measurements, I routinely prepare polycrystalline samples using:

- Solid-state reaction techniques  
- Multiple grinding and annealing cycles  
- Controlled-atmosphere synthesis for air-sensitive materials  

Powder samples are optimized for phase purity and homogeneity prior to characterization.

## Sample Preparation and Laboratory Techniques

I am experienced in advanced sample preparation workflows, including:

- **Quartz tube sealing using a blowtorch** under vacuum or inert gas  
- **High-temperature furnace operation** with controlled thermal profiles  
- **Glovebox handling** of air- and moisture-sensitive materials  
- Safe handling, storage, and disposal of reactive chemicals

## Outcome and Applications

The single-crystal and polycrystalline samples synthesized through this work have been successfully used for:

- Low-temperature heat capacity, magnetization, and transport measurements  
- Ultra-low-temperature AC susceptibility experiments  
- Neutron scattering and high-field measurements at national laboratories  

This synthesis and preparation work provides the experimental foundation for detailed investigations of magnetism, topology, and correlated electron behavior in quantum materials.
