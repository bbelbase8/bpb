## Overview

I have extensive hands-on experience in the synthesis of high-quality single-crystal and polycrystalline samples of quantum magnetic and correlated electron materials. My work emphasizes reproducible crystal growth, careful control of stoichiometry, and preparation of samples suitable for low-temperature and high-field measurements.

## Single-Crystal Growth

I have grown single crystals using multiple techniques, depending on material chemistry and phase stability:

- **Flux growth** for layered and intermetallic compounds  
- **Chemical vapor transport (CVT)** for halides and chalcogenides  
- **Bridgman growth** for selected bulk crystals  

Representative materials synthesized include:

- TlYbSe₂ (single crystals)
- TlYbS₂ (single crystals)
- YbCr₆Ge₆
- GdTe₃
- RI₃
- BaCo₂(AsO₄)₂
- Related rare-earth chalcogenides and intermetallic compounds

## Polycrystalline Sample Synthesis

For systematic studies and bulk measurements, I routinely prepare polycrystalline samples using:

- Solid-state reaction methods
- Multiple grinding and annealing cycles
- Controlled atmosphere synthesis for air-sensitive materials

## Sample Preparation and Laboratory Techniques

I am experienced in advanced sample preparation workflows, including:

- Quartz tube sealing using a blowtorch under vacuum or inert gas
- High-temperature furnace operation with controlled thermal profiles
- Glovebox handling of air- and moisture-sensitive materials

## Outcome and Applications

The samples synthesized through this work have been used in:

- Heat capacity, magnetization, and transport measurements
- Ultra-low-temperature AC susceptibility experiments
- Neutron scattering and high-field measurements at national laboratories
