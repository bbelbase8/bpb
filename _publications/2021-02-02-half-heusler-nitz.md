excerpt: "First-principles study of electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of 18-valence-electron half-Heusler alloys NiTZ (T = Sc, Ti; Z = P, As, Sn, Sb), demonstrating indirect band-gap semiconducting behavior and identifying enhanced thermoelectric performance through optimized doping, with ZT values up to ~0.46 at high temperature."
