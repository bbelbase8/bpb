## About me

I am a PhD student in experimental condensed matter physics at Purdue University. My research focuses on quantum magnetism and correlated electron systems, with an emphasis on rare-earth–based quantum materials. I am particularly interested in low-energy spin dynamics, frustrated magnetism, and emergent phenomena in low-dimensional systems.

My work combines crystal growth, thermodynamic and magnetic measurements, and neutron scattering techniques to understand how collective quantum behavior emerges in real materials. I have experience working with single crystals and polycrystalline samples, and I regularly collaborate with national laboratories and international research groups.

## Academic background

Before joining Purdue University, I received my undergraduate training in physics, where I developed a strong foundation in theoretical and computational methods. During my doctoral studies, I shifted toward experimental condensed matter physics, motivated by understanding how theoretical concepts manifest in real quantum materials.
