## About me

I am a PhD student in experimental condensed matter physics in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Purdue University. My research focuses on quantum magnetism and strongly correlated electron systems, with particular emphasis on rare-earth–based quantum materials. I am especially interested in low-energy spin dynamics, frustrated magnetism, and emergent quantum phases in low-dimensional systems.

Prior to joining Purdue, I received my undergraduate and master’s degree in physics at Tribhuvan University, Nepal. During this period, I was involved in research at the Central Department of Physics, where I worked in the Advanced Materials Research Laboratory (AMRL). This work provided a strong theoretical foundation and early exposure to the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of quantum materials, motivating my transition toward experimental research.

At Purdue University, my work combines single-crystal growth, ultra-low-temperature thermodynamic and magnetic measurements, electrical transport, and neutron scattering experiments to investigate collective quantum behavior in real materials. I have experience working with both single-crystalline and polycrystalline samples and regularly collaborate with national laboratories and international research groups.

## Academic background

My academic training began with a strong emphasis on theoretical and computational physics during my studies at Tribhuvan University. Through research experience and international collaborations, I developed a growing interest in understanding how theoretical concepts in quantum materials manifest in experiments. This motivation led me to pursue doctoral research in experimental condensed matter physics, where I now focus on uncovering emergent phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems.
